        <h3>Double Exposure Image Project</h3>
        <img src="images/DB.jpg" alt="graphic poster" class="project-image">
        <p>The double exposure image project involves creating visually captivating images by blending two or more photographs into a single composition. This technique overlays one image on top of another, allowing both to be seen simultaneously, creating a surreal and artistic effect. Typically, one image serves as the background, while the other is overlaid with reduced opacity to blend seamlessly. This project requires a keen eye for aesthetics, an understanding of image composition, and proficiency in photo editing software like Photoshop. The result is often a striking and dreamlike visual that conveys complex themes and emotions.</p>
